# Metapod Project

A collaborative endeavor to develop a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster on the cloud. This project leverages Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC), GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), and Amazon S3 for Terraform state management. It involves setting up and managing an Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) on AWS, with a focus on utilising AWS CLI for cloud operations and kubectl for Kubernetes interactions.

## Overview

Embarked on a hands-on cloud engineering journey, our team sequentially tackled challenges using a Trello-based workflow, enhanced by extensive diagrammatic planning and collaboration. We adopted Git best practices by utilising feature branches, ensuring a structured and efficient development process.
